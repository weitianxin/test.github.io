			<ul>
					
					<li>
						<b>Project: Multi-modal Neural machine translation with reinforcement learning methods</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The main task is to train a better translation model with the image description 
								dataset that are much easier to obtain but hard to use than traditional multi-lingual dataset;</li>
							<li>Conducted literature research on neural machine translation systems and reinforcement learning methods;
							<li>Design a novel reward function based on the image caption model to complete the reinforcement learning;</li>
							<li>Experimentally implemented a novel neural machine translation system based on google transformer, 
								and built image caption model on the pretrained translation model to generate the reward for reinforcement learning.</li>
							<li>We have nearly finished all the experiments, and is going to submit the paper to the upcoming conference ACL.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>Project: Speech emotion classification based on Speech spectrograms</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The main task is to do emotion classification, I mainly conducted the experiment and propose some ideas to improve the results;
								</li>
								<li>
									Conducted literature research and get familiar with the iemocap database;
								</li>
								<li>
									Replicated the theoretical derivation and program implementation in the classic papers;
								</li>
								<li>
									Conducted different experiments on the server to derive optimized parameters;
								</li>
							</ul>
